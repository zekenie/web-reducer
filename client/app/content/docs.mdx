## Concepts

"Hooks"–our unit of action–interact with the outside world through `readKey` and `writeKey` endpoints. `writeKeys` allow information to enter the system. `readKeys` allow information out of the system.

Your reducer code determines how the information entering the system is processed into the state exposed by `readKey`s.

## Functions you can write

The platform will call a number of functions in your code, if you define them.

### `responder`

```ts
function responder(req, secrets) {
  return {
    statusCode: 201,
    body: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <Response>
          <Dial>${secrets.PHONE_NUMBER}</Dial>
      </Response>`,
  };
}
```

Responders allow you to set custom status codes and response bodies for requests. They exist because some APIs, particularly webhook producers, sometimes expect specific responses in order to send subsequent requests.

If you return a status code > 399, the request will not be queued and will be ignored in state.

If you do not define a responder function, the default behavior is to respond with status `202` and a JSON string containing the request id.

```json
{ "id": "3af57774-b58c-4d74-9d12-13b2240e4cb7" }
```

### `reducer` <p className="badge bg-green-600 ml-4">replayable</p>

`reducer` determines how requests influence state. Requests run through the reducer are queued, so there are no race conditions and the state is deterministic. All requests are kept forever, so changes to your reducer code recompute the state.

```ts
function reducer(previousState, request, secrets) {}
```

### `getIdempotencyKey` <p className="badge bg-green-600 ml-4">replayable</p>

Sometimes clients, particularly webhook clients will resend requests that they believe have failed, but were actually processed. To prevent re-processing of the same requests, these APIs often provide you with an "idempotency key"–an identifier of the request that is identical for any subsequent requests. If you tell WebReducer how to find this key, we will ignore double requests for you.

```js
function getIdempotencyKey(request) {
  return request.headers['x-idempotency-key-or-whatever'];
}
```

### `query`
Query specifies the behavior of a `readKey` endpoint. By default, a client requesting a `readKey` will see the entire state object. However, in some cases, you may way clients to recieve some function of the state based on a query param. For example, if you had a state object containing a hash of user IDs to points, and wanted clients to only access the points for their user.

```json
{
  "3777b082-c424-4d19-b4b0-ef6ae30b83e4": 32,
  "cd635cd4-7b8d-41b0-8ac1-e7dfa32e2f1f": 12,
  // ...
}
```

You could write a `query` method to only respond with the points for a particular user.

```ts
function query(state, queryParams) {
  const idToLookup = queryParams.get("userId");
  if (!idToLookup) {
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      body: { error: 'missing `userId` query param.'}
    }
  }
  return { points: state[idToLookup] }
}
```

## Functions you can call

### Utility

#### `uuid`

Returns a UUID string.

```js
uuid()
// -> "3af57774-b58c-4d74-9d12-13b2240e4cb7"
```


### Crypto

The reason cryptographic functions are included is primarily to verify the authenticity of webhooks. That said, hashing functions can serve many purposes and you can use them for whatever you want.

All crypto hashes come directly from [Noble Hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes). The library has zero dependencies, is independently audited, and is all in javascript. Currently we don't expose the entire library, but focus instead on a few useful methods.

#### [`sha256`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes#sha2-sha256-sha384-sha512-sha512_256)

```js
toHex(sha256("foobar"));
// -> "c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2"
```

#### [`sha512`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes#sha2-sha256-sha384-sha512-sha512_256)

```js
toHex(sha512("foobar"));
// -> "0a50261ebd1a390fed2bf326f2673c145582a6342d523204973d0219337f81616a8069b012587cf5635f6925f1b56c360230c19b273500ee013e030601bf2425"
```

#### [`hmac`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes#hmac)

```js
toHex(hmac(sha256, "shh, super secret", '{ "payload": "here" }'));
// -> "4f9624a8027895e0b5150afe47248d76a8fc7e1c2d159e45edd62ddce0ad729a"
```

#### `toHex`

Noble Hash uses `UInt8Array`s internally and many of their methods return them. If you want a hex string, use this function.

## Interacting with a hook

Clients interact with hook from `readKeys` and `writeKeys` in the form of HTTP requests and websocket connections

### `readKey` endpoints

`readKeys` let clients see the current state. Requests made to `https://webreducer.dev/read/:readKey` will expose the current state. If you navigate your browser to that page, you'll see an HTML page containing a pretty representation of the state with live updates. If you `curl` the endpoint, you'll see JSON alone.

```sh
$ curl https://webreducer.dev/read/:readKey
# { "your": "state" }
```

#### Websockets

You can subscribe to state changes through a websocket. The socket endpoint is `https://webreducer.dev/state-events?readKey=:your-read-key` We publish two events `new-state` and `bulk-update`. `new-state` is triggered when a new request runs through the hook. `bulk-update` is triggered when a code changes causes a recomputation of the state. Both events contain a `type` and `state` field.

```json
{ "type": "new-state", "state": { "your": "state" } }
{ "type": "bulk-update", "state": { "your": "state" } }
```

Here's an example of how to use the socket from the browser.

(**In order to use the websocket we make availible** you must listen for and reply to `ping` messages. This allows us to clean up dead connections.)

```js
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://webreducer.dev/state-events?readKey=:your-read-key");

socket.addEventListener("message", (message) => {
  if (message.data === 'ping') {
    // this is required and allows us to close dead sockets
    // if you don't reply with pong, your socket will be 
    // closed after 15s.
    socket.send('pong')
  }
  const event = JSON.parse(message.data)
  switch(event.type) {
    case "bulk-update":
      // do something with event.state
      break;
    case "new-state":
      // do something with event.state
      break;
  }
});
```

### Write keys
